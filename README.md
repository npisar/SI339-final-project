# SI339-final-project
Created by Nick Pisarczyk

## Topic
This page was made to explain what Winter Guard International (WGI) is. In short, it's an orgaznization that organizes competitive indoor percussion ensembles. I go into depth about how WGI works, as well as my experience performing with WGI ensembles over the last few years.

## Coming Soon?
I may be adding information about Drum Corps International (DCI) and my experiences with those ensembles in the future, but it was outside the scope of this project.

## Resources
All resources used either came from my personal knowledge of the activity or different websites. All relevant sources are linked on the deployed page.
