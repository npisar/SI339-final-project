                        For nearly a half century, Drum Corps International, <em>Marching Music's Major Leagueâ„¢</em>, has been the leader in producing events for the world's most elite and exclusive marching ensembles for student musicians and performers. 
                        <br><br>
                        The mission of Drum Corps International is to bring the life-enriching benefits and enjoyment of marching music performing arts to more people worldwide.

                        I would describe WGI as a mix of drumline, theater, competition, and sport. It is an extremely phyiscally and mentally demanding activity. Top performers are asked to play extremely difficult and techinical music perfectly with one another while running (marching) around a gym or indoor space, along with doing elements of dance and choreography both with and without drums. Performers are athletes, hence "Sport of the Arts"; they have to train their bodies and minds to build the strength and fortitude to not only perform, but rehearse at an extremely high level.
                        <br><br>
                    <h2>General Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        DCI is professional marching band at the highest of levels. Every summer, members of over 50 drum corps based all around the US uproot their lives, tour across the country on buses, sleep on gym floors, and spend all day every day rehearsing and performing in an attempt to perfect a single marching band show. The season takes place 
                        <br><br>
                        A corps typically consists of an all-brass instrument hornline, a battery percussion section with marching snare drums, tenor drums, bass drums, and sometimes cymbals, and a front ensemble with keyboard instruments, accessory percussion, and electronics like synthesizers.
                        <br><br>
                        At the top level of the activity, every summer is a multi-million dollar production, including costs of housing and feeding members, designing the show, traveling from show site to show site. The top corps will travel over 10,000 miles, going around the country to shows in any combination of the midwest, southeast, southwest, and northeast.
