                <p tabindex="0" id="HIS-1">
                    Before I experienced anything musical through my schools, my parents enrolled me in piano lessons. That was really key for me-it got me involved with and excited about music super early on in my life. I took those lessons and got other general music lessons in elementary school until I eventually became old enough to choose an instrument for 5th grade band class. I started with a bell kit and small drumpad.

                    As I continued in band class throughout middle school, I remember seeing a drum cam video by an alumni of my high school. He was playing through the school cadence series marching into the stadium, and I thought it was the coolest thing in the world.

                    <em>"I want to do that,"</em> I remember thinking to myself. I started taking lessons with an instructor local to my area around the beginning of my eighth grade year. I worked extremely hard with him, probably harder than I had ever worked at something in my life. I wanted to make snare drum in the Dow High Drumline, and there were a lot of veteran members. I don't know what made me so interested in snare drum specifically; maybe it was the strange "traditional grip" used in the left hand, maybe it was that they were a always present high voice in the drumline sound. Regardless, after months of lessons and tons of hard work, it was time for the audition. And I got it! I made the snare line. I was also the only freshman to do so. You could say I felt pretty good about it, and I was definitely a little too cocky about it, especially considering what I know now about marching snare drumming!

                    <p tabindex="0">
                        I was always motivated to be a better musician. It's simply an inate drive I have. It's something I'm passionate about and love--it's as simple as that. I like long hours practicing. I like everything about it. I really started the grind of "getting good" during high school when my friend Bruce (who I was on the Dow High Drumline with) showed me a bunch of stuff about drum corps, the Michigan State Drumline (which he auditioned for and made), and when he was generally better than me. I wanted to drum better like he did.

                    <p tabindex="0">
                        Like I said, I discovered indoor and drum corps through those early high school experiences. I kept watching, and I thought it was the coolest thing in the world. I wanted to do it.
                    </p>
                    <p tabindex="0">
                        Why do I still do it, though? Well, I still love it. I love every part of it. I love driving to rehearsal with my friends. I love spending the night and complaining after a really tough day. I truly feel at home at rehearsals, performances, and anything related to either activity. I do it because of the people, the community. Everyone in the drumline world is so close to each other and, as a rule, wants each other to succeed. It's generally an extremely positive community focused on growth, education, and both self-improvement and group-improvement. I love the people who I've marched with in a special way. Regardless of whether we're best friends or not, I still have some form of love for everyone I've marched with.

                    <p tabindex="0">
                        I still do it because I've learned a ton of valuable life lessons. I'm a better communicator. I react to tough situations better than I used to. I'm more willing or ready for things to change quickly and have to adjust. I'm a better leader. I'm a better listener. I know what it means to work on something for a long time, and for it to succeed. I know what it means to work on something for a long, and for it to not work out. There's a lot of things I didn't realize I was picking up on that have made their way into my daily life.

                        And finally, I still do it because there are only a handful of people in the world who are trully <em>excellent</em> at something. That's something special. Not many people spend the 10,000 hours (or whatever arbitrary number you want to assign that it takes to master something). If I have the chance to be the <em>best in the world</em> at something, it would be insanely silly to pass up that chance or not put in the work.
