                    During the summer and winter, I rehearse and perform with <a href="#about-WGI">Winter Guard International (WGI)</a> and <a href="#about-DCI">Drum Corps International (DCI)</a> ensembles, respectively. In short, those are the governing bodies; the circuits that organize the different groups scattered around the country.

                    <p>
                        WGI Sport of the Arts is the world's premier organization producing indoor color guard, percussion, and winds competitions.  As a non-profit youth organization, WGI also serves as the governing body for the indoor color guard, percussion, and winds activities. It is called the Sport of the Arts because it brings music to life through performance in a competitive format. Even with over 45 years of history, the sport continues to evolve and grow. There were more than 40,000 participants at the regional level, and more than 12,000 participants at the Sport of the Arts World Championships this past April.
                        <br><br>
                        <em>The mission of WGI Sport of the Arts is to inspire and educate young performers around the world with unparalleled competitions and events with the spirit of inclusion, personal development, and community.</em>
                    </p>

                    <h2>General Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        I would describe WGI as a mix of drumline, theater, competition, and sport. It is an extremely phyiscally and mentally demanding activity. Top performers are asked to play extremely difficult and techinical music perfectly with one another while running (marching) around a gym or indoor space, along with doing elements of dance and choreography both with and without drums. Performers are athletes, hence "Sport of the Arts"; they have to train their bodies and minds to build the strength and fortitude to not only perform, but rehearse at an extremely high level.
                        <br><br>
                        <h3>Instrumentiation</h3>
                        A typical independent WGI group consists of roughly 15-25 battery percussionists playing marching snare drums, tenor drums, bass drums, and cymbals, 10-15 front ensemble members playing keyboard instruments, a drumset, accessory percussion, and electronics like synthesizers (all front ensemble are typically connected to speakers and amplified), and sometimes a visual ensemble who aim to add visual interest to the show or help move props around and don't typically play any instruments.
                        <br><br>
                        <h3>Competition</h3>
                        WGI is a competitive activity. Groups are judged based on the difficulty of their music and visual performance, how well they perform that content, and the design of their show. Typically, from around February to April, groups will begin competing with one another at state-circuit or WGI-sponsored competitions. There, judges appointed by the WGI organization will give feedback and scores for every group. The group with the highest score wins the competition.
                        <br><br>
                        <h3>Ensemble Classifcation</h3>
                        There are two main divisions of WGI percussion ensembles:
                        <br><br>
                            <li>
                                Scholastic: ensembles whose membership comes from the same high school (or a school that feeds in to that particular high school) or ensembles whose membership comes from multiple schools approved to combine resources by the principal.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Independent: ensembles whose members are not necessarily associated with a particular school.
                            </li>
                        <br>
                        Within those two divisions, there are four "classes" for percussion groups. These are represented with three letter acronyms like PIO (Percussion Independet Open) or PSW (Percussion Scholastic World).
                        <br><br>
                            <li>
                                A Class - Beginning programs and performers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Open Class - The intermediate developmental level of performers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                World Class - The most advanced programs and performers.
                            </li>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <h3>What a Performance Looks Like</h3>
                        Most groups will have a digitally-printed tarp, and some form of props. What a group does with their show is totally up to them, although WGI does have rules and regulations in place for performer safety and content guidelines. At a show, the group will roll their floor, all of their props, instruments, and electronics onto the floor in front of a timing line. When a judge gives a go, a 9 to 11 minute timer starts, depending on the classifcation of the ensemble. World Class shows can be up to 8 minutes long, with the remaining 3 of 11 minutes spent setting up and tearing down the entire operation so the next group can make it in and perform their show.

                        <h3>WGI Finals</h3>
                        In mid April every year, roughly 250 of the percussion groups from around the country--ranging from those ran out of high schools to independent groups run by nonprofit organizations--converge on Dayton, Ohio for the WGI Percussion World Championships, the final event of the year. Each group will perform in prelims against other groups of their class, and only the top 24 of all of those groups will advance to semifinals. Only the top 12 of those semifinalists will advance to finals. Each class' events are held separately.

                        For nearly a half century, Drum Corps International, <em>Marching Music's Major League™</em>, has been the leader in producing events for the world's most elite and exclusive marching ensembles for student musicians and performers. 
                        <br><br>

                    <h2>General Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every summer, members of over 50 drum corps based all around the US uproot their lives, tour across the country on buses, sleep on gym floors, and spend all day every day rehearsing and performing in an attempt to perfect a single marching band show.
                        <br><br>
                        A corps typically consists of an all-brass instrument hornline, a battery percussion section with marching snare drums, tenor drums, bass drums, and sometimes cymbals, and a front ensemble with keyboard instruments, accessory percussion, and electronics like synthesizers.
                        <br><br>
                        At the top level of the activity, every summer is a multi-million dollar production, including costs of housing and feeding members, designing the show, traveling from show site to show site. The top corps will travel over 10,000 miles, going around the country to shows in any combination of the midwest, southeast, southwest, and northeast.
