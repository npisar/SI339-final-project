                    I've loved playing the snare drum since 5th grade, and specifically the marching snare drum since 7th grade. I've taken that passion to an extreme most people don't know exists.

                    During the winter and summer, I rehearse and perform with <a href="#about-WGI">Winter Guard International (WGI)</a> and <a href="#about-DCI">Drum Corps International (DCI)</a> ensembles, respectively (pages about DCI coming soon!). In short, those are governing bodies that organize professional marching bands or indoor drumline ensembles scattered around the country.

            <h2>How I Started Marching Drumming</h2>
            <section class="how-I-started">
                <p id="HIS-1">
                    Before I experienced anything musical through my schools, my parents enrolled me in piano lessons. That was really key for me-it got me involved with and excited about music super early on in my life. I took those lessons and got other general music lessons in elementary school until I eventually became old enough to choose an instrument for 5th grade band class. I started with a bell kit and small drumpad.
                </p>
                <p id="HIS-2">
                    As I continued in band class throughout middle school, I remember seeing a drum cam video by an alumni of my high school. He was playing through the school cadence series marching into the stadium, and I thought it was the coolest thing in the world.

                <p id="HIS-4">
                    <em>"I want to do that,"</em> I remember thinking to myself. I started taking lessons with an instructor local to my area around the beginning of my eighth grade year. I worked extremely hard with him, probably harder than I had ever worked at something in my life. I wanted to make snare drum in the Dow High Drumline, and there were a lot of veteran members. I don't know what made me so interested in snare drum specifically; maybe it was the strange "traditional grip" used in the left hand, maybe it was that they were a always present high voice in the drumline sound. Regardless, after months of lessons and tons of hard work, it was time for the audition. And I got it! I made the snare line. I was also the only freshman to do so. You could say I felt pretty good about it, and I was definitely a little too cocky about it, especially considering what I know now about marching snare drumming!

                    So that's how I started playing the marching snare drum. But how did I end up going from Dow High Marching Band to spending thousands of dollars and nearly all of my free time to wear goofy outfits, run around a gym or football field, and practice the snare drum every day?
