11/26/24 - 360m - lots of content additions and html / css work. added js elements too and took dark / light mode toggle from CPD4

11/28/24 - 90m - finished content on WGI page. Is DCI within the scope right now?
    Hour calc: 50+50+30+240+90+360+90 = 15h / 20h
    so NO, not within scope right now. I should pivot and only focus on WGI for now. If I have time I can always add drum corps information--I've already done most of the work.
