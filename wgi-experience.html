                        I started performing with WGI ensembles in 2022 as a high school junior. I had initially found the activity through YouTube and was interested in performing in it myself.

                        My first experience with anything WGI-related was going to an audition. In October 2022, I went to an audition for a world class group based out of Plymouth, Michigan called Redline. In the audition room, I was surrounded by 19-22 year olds as an almost-17-year old. I was a little intimiated, but I didn't really know enough about marching drumming to even consider that I would get cut. I thought I had it all figured out. Safe to say: I didn't.

                    <p tabindex="0">
                        After getting cut from Redline in 2022 (by the end of that audition day, I figured as much was going to happen), I decided to go out to another audition: MidMichigan Impact. This was an A class group led by my high school drumline instructor, Chris Sabourin. Impact was based right in Midland where I was going to school, and it was super convenient to get to rehearsal--only a 20 minute drive at max. Impact was formerly known as the Resonators Drumline, but had been competitively inactive for a few years. They had started getting back together in 2021, and 2022 was their official return to competition under the new name.
                    </p>
                    <p tabindex="0">
                        I sent my audition in to Chris in late October, and was offered a spot on snare drum, which I took. I was eventually named the snare drum section leader, too. There were a lot of things Impact introduced me to: the struggle to find rehearsal spaces, having to load and unload the trailer with all of the equipment every rehearsal, and generally what the indoor drumline activity <em>was.</em> It was an extremely important season for me, and is the reason I'm still doing indoor percussion today. It was my first time being in a group where I worked on one show over and over again for an entire season. I loved it! I was introduced to a lot of really knowledgeable people through it too--some of the staff members particularly were excellent musicians who pushed me to become a better drummer and performer.

                    <p tabindex="0">
                        The show this season was called "The Groove Club." It was swing and jazz-inspired, and I had my first experience doing very basic character work and acting / performing, both while playing and without the drums on.
                    </p>
                    <p tabindex="0">
                        Impact did not travel to Dayton, OH for WGI World Championships. It was too expensive for the group, and we were overall an extremely young group who didn't know much about the activity yet. Impact always aimed to be competitive, but Chris' main goal was to get students involved / engaged with music and teach students life lessons like teamwork, accountability, dedicated hard work, and perseverance through the indoor drumline activity. Check out this video of our show from mid March. It wasn't the final version of the show, but it's the last video I have of it.

                    <p tabindex="0">
                        Motor City Percussion (shortened to MCP) was my first step into Open Class indoor drumline. I spent more time preparing for the audition, even posting progress videos on my Instagram account. I remember going to the clinic that they held and being a little surprised by how different it was from Impact. The expectations were different, the people around me were drumming better than I was. It was an entirely new atmosphere. And the auditions were also far away. I had to make nearly a two hour drive to get there. If I were to make it, rehearsal would be every single weekend, all day on Saturday and half of the day on Sunday. I would have much harder music, a ton more visual and performance responsibilities (which I didn't even know about or consider at the time), and generally be far more challenged as a performer than I was at Impact in 2022.

                        I ended up securing a contract (upon getting a spot with any ensemble, members are given a literal contract which outlines expectations, their dues, etc.) in October and started rehearsing with MCP as an open class performer. By now, I was a high school senior, 17 going on 18. This was a big conversation with my parents; was I going to be able to balance my senior year, family, friends, and driving 2 hours there and back to MCP every weekend? I made the committment to do so--and it was by no means easy. Especially during the spring, going to MCP as well as preparing for my Michigan Drumline auditions was an extremely tiring time, not to mention maintaining my grades on top of that.

                        Marching or doing choreography and playing at the same time is <em>hard.</em> I vividly remember that every time we would get new drill or choreography, I would have a huge struggle trying to put my hands with my feet. I had simply never done it before. This season, I gained a new appreciation for what the groups at the top of the activity were doing. I had a new frame of reference for how insanely difficult the stuff they pull off is.

                    <p tabindex="0">
                        The third thing unique about WGI is how connected the community is, and that almost no one is in it for the money. Everyone knows everyone in the drumline world, and typically we all have something nice to say about names we recognize. Trust in individuals, brands, and groups runs deep in the activity, because where it is today wouldn't be possible without the dedicated community backing it up. Many staff members at most groups, regardless of size, aren't walking home with a big paycheck. In fact, many of them lose money every season. Almost everyone around truly cares about indoor drumline and wants to pass on the joy of performing in it and the valuable life lessons they've learned doing it along to the next generation of marching members.

                            WGI is a competitive activity. Groups are judged based on the difficulty of their music and visual performance, how well they perform that content, and the design of their show. At the state, WGI regional, and WGI finals shows, judges appointed by the WGI organization will give feedback and scores for every group. The group with the highest score wins the competition.

                            Most WGI groups will begin the season in October to November with auditions. Auditions test performers on their marching and playing abilities, both separately and together, as well as their mental game and performance quailties. The staff selects the members they believe will best meet the demands of the group for that season. Groups typically release an audition packet a 1-4 months before the audition, which normally contains exercises, show music excerpts, and information on how that specific group plans to approach each instrument.

                            After the ensemble has been set, independent groups will start rehearsing on the weekends. For many, that means at least all day on Saturday and half or two thirds of the day on Sunday. Many groups, especially World Class groups, also rehearse Friday nights.

                            Many ensembles will also rehearse around the holidays with a 3-5 long day "camp" where they work on a large portion of their show. In around February, most groups will start going to competitions in state circuits. <a tabindex="0" href="#competition">Read more about how competitions work below.</a> Along with state circuit competitions, there are also WGI-sponsored regional competitions. These attract groups from around the area. For example, many groups from Michigan, Ohio, and other places around the midwest attend the WGI Mid-East Regional hosted in Kentucky. Every group must attend at least one WGI regional if they want to attend WGI Finals, unless there are no regional competitions within 400 miles of where they're based.

                            The goal of a WGI percussion ensemble is for every performer on the floor to perform their music and visual package as close to perfectly as possible. That's a tall order. The act of moving and playing an instrument on it's own is <em>hard</em>. The performers in WGI are typically marching around the floor at tempos of upwards of 180 beats per minutes, and playing music that takes years of dedicated work to even be able to perform standing still.

                            "Clean" is a word thrown around a lot. If something is truly "clean", it maens that the people performing the material are performing it at the exact same moment in the <em>exact same way</em>. That level of synchronization, mastery over both body and instrument, and also the additional ability to perform in a way that's engaging and meaningful to the audience is what nesseciates that many hours of rehearsal.

                            In the A classes (PIA and PSA), every group performs in prelims against all of the other A class groups, and the top 15 of all of those groups advance to finals.

                            In the Open and World classes, every group will perform in prelims against other groups of their class, and only the top 24 of all of those groups will advance to semifinals. Only the top 15 of those semifinalists will advance to finals.

                            Each class' events are held separately. The idea of the classifcation system is to allow the groups that are attempting to perform content of similar levels of complexity to compete agaisnt each other. This way, there's a realistic chance for groups of all talent levels, membership, etc. to have competitive success.

                            All of that rehearsal is to prepare for WGI finals. So: what does a performance there actually look like?
                        </p>
                        <p tabindex="0">
                            To give a quick synopsis of what shows look like: most groups will have a digitally-printed tarp, and some form of props. What a group does with their show is totally up to them, although WGI does have rules and regulations in place for performer safety and content guidelines. At a show, the group will roll their floor, all of their props, instruments, and electronics onto the floor in front of a timing line. When a judge gives a go, a 9 to 11 minute timer starts, depending on the classifcation of the ensemble. World Class shows can be up to 8 minutes long, with the remaining 3 of 11 minutes spent setting up and tearing down the entire operation so the next group can make it in and perform their show.

                            Here are some videos of shows I've found influential, impactful, or otherwise awesome. They're a large part of the reason why I'm so invested in the activity today.

                            WGI is an activity that's been extremely important to me over the last 3-4 years of my life. I was already getting into it watching shows online and warmup videos of drumlines I liked, but I loved it even more as soon as I started doing it myself. My appreciation for the activity and the people who I do it with is even greater than it was even a year ago at this point.
