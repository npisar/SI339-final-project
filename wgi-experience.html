                        I started performing with WGI ensembles in 2022 as a high school junior. I had initially found the activity through YouTube and was interested in performing in it myself.

                        My first experience with anything WGI-related was going to an audition. In October 2022, I went to an audition for a world class group based out of Plymouth, Michigan called Redline. In the audition room, I was surrounded by 19-22 year olds as an almost-17-year old. I was a little intimiated, but I didn't really know enough about marching drumming to even consider that I would get cut. I thought I had it all figured out. Safe to say: I didn't.

                    <p tabindex="0">
                        After getting cut from Redline in 2022 (by the end of that audition day, I figured as much was going to happen), I decided to go out to another audition: MidMichigan Impact. This was an A class group led by my high school drumline instructor, Chris Sabourin. Impact was based right in Midland where I was going to school, and it was super convenient to get to rehearsal--only a 20 minute drive at max. Impact was formerly known as the Resonators Drumline, but had been competitively inactive for a few years. They had started getting back together in 2021, and 2022 was their official return to competition under the new name.
                    </p>
                    <p tabindex="0">
                        I sent my audition in to Chris in late October, and was offered a spot on snare drum, which I took. I was eventually named the snare drum section leader, too. There were a lot of things Impact introduced me to: the struggle to find rehearsal spaces, having to load and unload the trailer with all of the equipment every rehearsal, and generally what the indoor drumline activity <em>was.</em> It was an extremely important season for me, and is the reason I'm still doing indoor percussion today. It was my first time being in a group where I worked on one show over and over again for an entire season. I loved it! I was introduced to a lot of really knowledgeable people through it too--some of the staff members particularly were excellent musicians who pushed me to become a better drummer and performer.

                    <p tabindex="0">
                        The show this season was called "The Groove Club." It was swing and jazz-inspired, and I had my first experience doing very basic character work and acting / performing, both while playing and without the drums on.
                    </p>
                    <p tabindex="0">
                        Impact did not travel to Dayton, OH for WGI World Championships. It was too expensive for the group, and we were overall an extremely young group who didn't know much about the activity yet. Impact always aimed to be competitive, but Chris' main goal was to get students involved / engaged with music and teach students life lessons like teamwork, accountability, dedicated hard work, and perseverance through the indoor drumline activity. Check out this video of our show from mid March. It wasn't the final version of the show, but it's the last video I have of it.

                        Motor City Percussion (shortened to MCP) was my first step into Open Class indoor drumline. I spent more time preparing for the audition, even posting progress videos on my Instagram account. I remember going to the clinic that they held and being a little surprised by how different it was from Impact. The expectations were different, the people around me were drumming better than I was. It was an entirely new atmosphere. And the auditions were also far away. I had to make nearly a two hour drive to get there. If I were to make it, rehearsal would be every single weekend, all day on Saturday and half of the day on Sunday. I would have much harder music, a ton more visual and performance responsibilities (which I didn't even know about or consider at the time), and generally be far more challenged as a performer than I was at Impact in 2022.

                        I ended up securing a contract (upon getting a spot with any ensemble, members are given a literal contract which outlines expectations, their dues, etc.) in October and started rehearsing with MCP as an open class performer. By now, I was a high school senior, 17 going on 18. This was a big conversation with my parents; was I going to be able to balance my senior year, family, friends, and driving 2 hours there and back to MCP every weekend? I made the committment to do so--and it was by no means easy. Especially during the spring, going to MCP as well as preparing for my Michigan Drumline auditions was an extremely tiring time, not to mention maintaining my grades on top of that.

                        Marching or doing choreography and playing at the same time is <em>hard.</em> I vividly remember that every time we would get new drill or choreography, I would have a huge struggle trying to put my hands with my feet. I had simply never done it before. This season, I gained a new appreciation for what the groups at the top of the activity were doing. I had a new frame of reference for how insanely difficult the stuff they pull off is.

                        Have you heard of the Dunning-Krueger effect? I got hit by that hard this season. There was so much I didn't know about WGI and drums in general. Every weekend, something I had never heard of or experienced before was thrown at me. New ideas of how to approach the instrument, how to rehearse better, what it meant to play clean with a group (and to not play clean). I felt like my brain and ears expanded a ton during this season--more so than I even thought they would. I thought I had it figured out; I didn't.

                    <p tabindex="0">
                        The show this year was called "The Night Shift." It was about janitors in an 80's, memphis-style-themed mall. While all the other janitors were working and trying to clean up the mall before it opened in the morning, one lazy janitor is slacking on the job, playing an air keytar solo on a mop, sleeping on a couch, and otherwise putting off her work.

                        The show was extremely camp-y and straightforward / linear, but it was super fun to perform in, as well as a crowd favorite. We were featured in a popular drumline YouTuber's video about his favorite WGI shows this year!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p tabindex="0">
                        All of the hard work we put in was extremely worth it. MCP ended up making WGI finals that year, finishing in 15th place overall. The season was a blast; I'm still very good friends with so many of the people I marched with that year. The music and drill was pretty challenging for me at the time, too. I loved MCP 2023, and it was the perfect next step for me to take into the WGI activity. Check out our final run of the show at WGI World Championships, our final "lot" performance (drumlines warmup in parking lots before shows), my GoPro headcam of the show, and a really early rehearsal!.

                        Motor City Percussion (shortened to MCP) was my first step into Open Class indoor drumline. I spent more time preparing for the audition, even posting progress videos on my Instagram account. I remember going to the clinic that they held and being a little surprised by how different it was from Impact. The expectations were different, the people around me were drumming better than I was. It was an entirely new atmosphere. And the auditions were also far away. I had to make nearly a two hour drive to get there. If I were to make it, rehearsal would be every single weekend, all day on Saturday and half of the day on Sunday. I would have much harder music, a ton more visual and performance responsibilities (which I didn't even know about or consider at the time), and generally be far more challenged as a performer than I was at Impact in 2022.

                        I ended up securing a contract (upon getting a spot with any ensemble, members are given a literal contract which outlines expectations, their dues, etc.) in October and started rehearsing with MCP as an open class performer. By now, I was a high school senior, 17 going on 18. This was a big conversation with my parents; was I going to be able to balance my senior year, family, friends, and driving 2 hours there and back to MCP every weekend? I made the committment to do so--and it was by no means easy. Especially during the spring, going to MCP as well as preparing for my Michigan Drumline auditions was an extremely tiring time, not to mention maintaining my grades on top of that.

                        Marching or doing choreography and playing at the same time is <em>hard.</em> I vividly remember that every time we would get new drill or choreography, I would have a huge struggle trying to put my hands with my feet. I had simply never done it before. This season, I gained a new appreciation for what the groups at the top of the activity were doing. I had a new frame of reference for how insanely difficult the stuff they pull off is.

                        Have you heard of the Dunning-Krueger effect? I got hit by that hard this season. There was so much I didn't know about WGI and drums in general. Every weekend, something I had never heard of or experienced before was thrown at me. New ideas of how to approach the instrument, how to rehearse better, what it meant to play clean with a group (and to not play clean). I felt like my brain and ears expanded a ton during this season--more so than I even thought they would. I thought I had it figured out; I didn't.

                        The show this year was called "The Night Shift." It was about janitors in an 80's, memphis-style-themed mall. While all the other janitors were working and trying to clean up the mall before it opened in the morning, one lazy janitor is slacking on the job, playing an air keytar solo on a mop, sleeping on a couch, and otherwise putting off her work.

                        The show was extremely camp-y and straightforward / linear, but it was super fun to perform in, as well as a crowd favorite. We were featured in a popular drumline YouTuber's video about his favorite WGI shows this year!

                        All of the hard work we put in was extremely worth it. MCP ended up making WGI finals that year, finishing in 15th place overall. The season was a blast; I'm still very good friends with so many of the people I marched with that year. The music and drill was pretty challenging for me at the time, too. I loved MCP 2023, and it was the perfect next step for me to take into the WGI activity. Check out our final run of the show at WGI World Championships, our final "lot" performance (drumlines warmup in parking lots before shows), my GoPro headcam of the show, and a really early rehearsal!.

                            WGI is an activity that's been extremely important to me over the last 3-4 years of my life. I was already getting into it watching shows online and warmup videos of drumlines I liked, but I loved it even more as soon as I started doing it myself. My appreciation for the activity and the people who I do it with is even greater than it was even a year ago at this point.
