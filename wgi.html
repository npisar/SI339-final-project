        <h2>My Experiences</h2>
        I've been rehearsing and perform with indoor percussion groups in Michigan since 2022. My experience includes:
        From 2023 on, that's meant giving up nearly every single weekend from Novemeber through mid April to rehearse. For Redline, the Independent World Class group I'm currently inovled with based out of Plymouth, Michigan, a typical weekend looks like:
        <br><br>
        Friday - 8pm-12am
        <br>Saturday - 10am-11pm
        <br>Sunday - 10am-5:30pm
        <br><br>
        Why do we need to rehearse so much? The goal of a WGI group is to put together a technincally impressive and emotionally impactful production. In the drumline world, you'll hear people comment on whether or not something was "clean." What does "clean" mean? It means a group of people performing something in tandem with one another in a way where the sounds they produce from their instruments and the movement of their bodies is as close to perfectly in sync as possible.
